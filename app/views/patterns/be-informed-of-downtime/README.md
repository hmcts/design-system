Inform users of upcoming downtime.

<img src="/public/images/downtime-warning.png" alt="A screenshot of the downtime warning pattern in use. It is placed directly above the H1." />

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when you know in advance that your service will be unavailable.

## How it works

The pattern uses the information variant of the <a href="/components/banner">banner pattern</a>.

The banner should be shown on the first page the user sees after logging in, and then not shown again for that session. If they log in again before the downtime, it would be shown again.

## Research on this component

This pattern has been discussed in a design crit. We'll update this section once it's been tested with users.
