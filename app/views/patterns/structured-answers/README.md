## When to use this pattern

If users want to or are required to, provide longer and more complex responses. They may need help in focusing on relevant points and structuring their response.

Those reading the response would also benefit from it being more focused and structured in a consistent format.


## How it works

HMCTS cannot provide advice on what to write as this would compromise its impartiality. It can, however, help users to understand what to respond to and assist in structuring their answers.

In the SSCS 'Reasons for appealing' example above users are asked to respond to points made by DWP in the Mandatory Reconsideration Notice or decision letter.

The 'What' and 'Why' form fields provide structure and users are able to add multiple reasons using the 'Add another' button.

At least one response is required but users should just be allowed to complete just one field. The form structure is there to assist but doesn't need to be enforced.


## Research on this pattern
### Key insights
- Users can be intimidated by a single large text box.
- Providing focus and structure helps overcome barriers to users articulating themselves. 
- SSCS judges and DWP have reported that the quality of Reasons for appeal responses have improved and consequently they're able to make more informed decisions.
