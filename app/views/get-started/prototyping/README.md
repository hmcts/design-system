This guide explains how to create prototypes using the HMCTS Design System and GOV.UK Prototype Kit.

## Before you start

First you must have followed the [GOV.UK Design System prototype setup guide](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/prototyping/).

## Setting up HMCTS Frontend

The Design System uses HMCTS Frontend. To get it running follow these steps:

1. Open terminal
2. Change the directory to your prototype. For example, `cd path/to/protoype`
3. Run `npm install --save @hmcts/frontend`
4. Run `npm start`
