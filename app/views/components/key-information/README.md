## When to use this pattern

Users attention needs to be focused on specific content within the body of a page.

This could be a summary of the page or key information the user should take away.

For example in SSCS it's used to highlight appeal status messages which inform the users what's just happened, what will happen next and by when.

## How it works

The pale blue panel attracts users focus and draws users to read the content.

This is particularly helpful where there is a lot of content on the page or where users have conditions which affect user ability to focus, for example, dyslexia.


## Research on this pattern

SSCS has tested this pattern on the Submit your appeal confirmation screen, Track your appeal and the Online resolution preliminary view and decision screens. Participants gave positive feedback in all scenarios. They were drawn to the panel and were able to playback the key information it contained.
