Use the MyHMCTS Branded Header component for any service or system not hosted on GOV.UK such as those for the judiciary or HMCTS staff.

Do not use this for citizen-facing services.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'branded-header',
  example: 'default',
  height: 150
})}}

## How it works

MyHMCTS is displayed on the 'Left', with the name of the service or system appearing off-centered left. You can also add global links in the top right. For example, ‘Profile’ and ‘Sign out’.

## Research on this component

We’ll update this section once it has been tested.
